    """Computes the optimal cost and the optimal control input for each
    state of the state space solving the stochastic shortest
    path problem by:
            - Value Iteration;
            - Policy Iteration;
            - Linear Programming;
            - or a combination of these.

    Args:
        P  (np.array): A (K x K x L)-matrix containing the transition probabilities
                       between all states in the state space for all control inputs.
                       The entry P(i, j, l) represents the transition probability
                       from state i to state j if control input l is applied
        Q  (np.array): A (K x L)-matrix containing the expected stage costs of all states
                       in the state space for all control inputs. The entry G(i, l)
                       represents the cost if we are in state i and apply control
                       input l
        Constants: The constants describing the problem instance.

    Returns:
        np.array: The optimal cost to go for the stochastic SPP
        np.array: The optimal control policy for the stochastic SPP
